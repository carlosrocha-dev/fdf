## Objectives

Itâ€™s time for you to create a basic computer graphics project!
You are going to use the school graphical library: the MiniLibX! This library was
developed internally and includes basic necessary tools to open a window, create images
and deal with keyboard and mouse events.
This will be the opportunity for you to get familiar with the MiniLibX, to discover the
basics of graphics programming, especially how to place points in space, join them
and, most important, how to see the scene from a specific viewpoint.
